  * Analazing the crime data on google maps according to the latitude and longtitude of each crimes
      * We found a lot of crimes commited at the center of the city.
      * Though both stadium are not too far away from the center of the city (about 3 km), there are not a lot of crimes around the statium on both game days and off days (see the heatmaps)
      * We will further analyze the crimes committed at the center of the city, around both stadium on home game days and off days
  
  * Crimes around stadiums and center of city on both home game and no game days
    * Manchster Uniter stadium (Old Trafford)
    ![](Images/Manchester_united_2km.png)
      * Even on off game day, there are not a lot of crimes committed around the stadium (2km range)
      * On home game day, less crimes are committed around the stadium

    * Manchester City stadium (Etihad)
    ![](Images/Manchester_city_2km.png)
      * More game are committed around the Manchester City Stadium then around Manchester United Stadium (2km range)
      * On home game day, the crimes were not going down around the stadium

    * Center of the city of Manchester
    ![](Images/Center_of_Manchester_3km.png)
      * Crime number at the center of the city went down on 8/10 (36.09% decrease) and 8/19 (52.07% decrease), but went up on 8/27(7.84% increase)
      * 8/27/2018 is also a National Holiday for England, so the increase might come from effects of national holiday activities.
      * The lowest crime counts at the center of the city in August was on 8/19, when both home game (for Manchester City) and away game(for Manchester United) were held. 
* Limitation of our analysis:
  1. We can only got the daily crime data for August 2018, which is the first month of the 2018/2019 EPL season. There are only five game days (3 home, 3 away and 1 oerlap) in Manchester in August 2018, So we have limited data for our statitics analysis
  2. 8/27 is also a national holiday in England. And we can not ruled out that the activities on national holiday will also affect the crime rate on that day. 
  3. The hourly data depends on the time when crime were reported, not really the same time that crime occurred.
  4. We have not compared our data with the data from other city, for lacking the daily crime data in othe cities in England.
